This is mostly an **abandoned attempt** to create a little game (uglyly forked from "Space Company") where you learn more about Personal, Plural and Collective Resources.

I just tweaked the narrative.

It's a *click-to-win* game.
Click a resource, gain a resource, build your Space Learning System.
Simple. Very addictive if you have really nothing else to do. :)

Maybe someday, I'll come back to it and give a closure to the story.
